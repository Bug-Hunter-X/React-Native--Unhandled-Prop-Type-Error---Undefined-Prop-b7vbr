This error occurs when using a component that expects a specific prop type, but that prop is undefined or of the wrong type.  It often happens when data fetching is asynchronous, and the component tries to render before the data has arrived. For instance, if you're fetching user data and try to display the user's name before the fetch is complete, you'll get this error.

```javascript
// Buggy component
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Name: {user.name}</Text> // Error here if user is undefined
    </View>
  );
}
```
